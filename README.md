# ![Icon](https://github.com/Periapsises/SandboxImproved/blob/main/icon24.png?raw=true) Sandbox Improved

## An improved sandbox gamemode (Hopefully)

### What this is about

**Sandbox Improved** is a Gamemode that strips as much as possible from Garry's Mod's [**Base Gamemode**](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/tree/master/garrysmod/gamemodes/base) and replaces it with a better Lua API.  
The goal is to let addon developpers make more efficient addons as well as server owners manage their servers better.

### Work in progress

This project is still in progress and very early in developpement.
A Wiki will be added once more is setup and updates will be posted to keep track of everything that changes that needs replacements if anyone somehow makes addon for this already.
